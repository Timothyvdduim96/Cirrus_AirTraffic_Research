The data included in this Github repository is due to storage space limitations not complete.
Nonetheless each data source is represented at the least by some subset of the data used.

- The "Flight_data" folder contains interpolated air traffic data for the first days of March 2015, retrieved from EUROCONTROL's OpenSky network. All original
files are too large to include in this repository for now.
- The "Meteosat_CLAAS_data" contains granules in 15 min intervals of 11/03/2015.
- The "ERA5_data" folder used to contain a .nc file for March, June, September and December 2016 of ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis product on pressure levels
(100hPa - 400hPa in steps of 50hPa). It contains the products "relative humidity" and "temperature" on a 0.25x0.25deg grid for the subsetted ROI.
This file was too large to include now in the Github repository.
- The "CALIPSO_data" folder contains LIDAR data for one month (March 2015) where each file represents one overpass over the ROI.
- The "Additional_data" folder contains the "airports.csv" file at this moment (retrieved from OpenFlights.org), which is used to link
ICAO codes to airport names.
- The "Cloudsat_data" folder contains the 2BCLDCLASS-LIDAR product from Cloudsat/CALIPSO for 1st March 2015. This data could optionally be
used as validation tool.

Furthermore folders are present containing relevant literature, Python scripts used and visual outputs of those scripts.
